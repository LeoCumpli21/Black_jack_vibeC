# Casino Black Jack Table Rules

## Single Player

The goal of the game is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21.

*   **Card Values:**
    *   Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
    *   Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are each worth 10.
    *   Aces can be worth 1 or 11, whichever is more favorable to the hand.

*   **Blackjack (Natural 21):**
    *   If a player is dealt an Ace and a 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, or King) as their first two cards, it is a "Blackjack" or a "natural 21".
    *   A player's Blackjack beats any other hand value of 21.
    *   The standard payout for a player's Blackjack is 3 to 2.

*   **Gameplay:**
    1.  The player places a bet.
    2.  The dealer deals two cards to the player and two cards to themselves. One of the dealer's cards is face up, the other is face down.
    3.  The player can choose to "hit" (take another card), "stand" (keep their current hand), or "split" if they have two cards of the same value.
    4.  If the player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose their bet.
    5.  Once the player stands, the dealer reveals their face-down card.
    6.  The dealer must hit until their hand is worth at least 17. Some casinos require the dealer to hit on a "soft 17" (a hand totaling 17 with an Ace), while others require them to stand. This rule varies.
    7.  If the dealer busts, the player wins.
    8.  If neither busts, the hand closest to 21 wins.
    9.  If the player and dealer have the same hand value, it's a "push" and the player's bet is returned.

*   **Splitting Pairs:**
    *   If a player's first two cards are of the same value (e.g., two 8s or a King and a Jack), they have the option to "split" them into two separate hands.
    *   To do this, the player must place a second bet equal to their original bet.
    *   The dealer then deals a second card to each of the new hands.
    *   The player plays each hand independently, hitting or standing as they see fit.
    *   If a player splits Aces, they usually only receive one additional card for each Ace.

*   **Double Down:**
    *   After receiving their first two cards, a player has the option to "double down".
    *   This means they double their original bet and receive exactly one more card.

*   **Insurance:**
    *   If the dealer's upcard is an Ace, players are offered an "insurance" bet.
    *   This is a side bet that the dealer has Blackjack.
    *   The insurance bet is typically half of the player's original bet.
    *   If the dealer has Blackjack, the insurance bet pays 2 to 1. If the dealer does not have Blackjack, the player loses the insurance bet.

*   **Surrender:**
    *   Some casinos allow a player to "surrender" their hand after the initial deal.
    *   If a player chooses to surrender, they forfeit half of their bet and their hand is over.

*   **Push (Tie):**
    *   If the player and the dealer have the same hand value, it is a "push".
    *   In the event of a push, the player's bet is returned.
    *   If both the player and the dealer have Blackjack, it is also a push.

*   **Betting and Payouts:**
    *   The payout for a regular win is 1 to 1.
    *   Table betting limits (minimum and maximum bets) will be displayed at the table.

*   **Deck Composition:**
    *   Blackjack is typically played with one to eight 52-card decks.
    *   The cards are shuffled after a certain number of hands or when the deck penetration reaches a certain point, as determined by the casino.

## Multiple Players

When multiple players are at the table, the game proceeds as follows:

*   **Betting:** All players place their bets before the cards are dealt.
*   **Dealing:** The dealer deals cards to each player, one at a time, from left to right. The dealer receives their cards last.
*   **Player Turns:** Each player takes their turn, starting from the player on the dealer's left. A player can hit or stand. Once a player stands or busts, the turn moves to the next player.
*   **Dealer's Turn:** After all players have completed their turns, the dealer plays their hand according to the standard rules.
*   **Payouts:** The dealer pays out winnings and collects losses from each player individually.
